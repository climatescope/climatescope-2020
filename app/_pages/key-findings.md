A cool down in Mainland China and several other major economies depressed 2018 clean energy investment across emerging nations and kept overall deployment rates flat year-on-year. Meanwhile, coal-fired generation surged in the 104 markets BloombergNEF assessed for its annual Climatescope survey. Both suggest that despite considerable recent progress, developing countries’ power sector CO2 emissions are rising rapidly.

There were silver linings in 2018, of course. For the second year in a row, emerging nations built more clean than fossil-fueled power-generating capacity. Construction of new coal-fired power plants fell to its lowest level in a decade. Excluding Mainland China, clean energy installations grew by 21% year-on-year to hit a new record. And the number of emerging markets with three or more clean energy-friendly policy types on the books rose to 62 of those analyzed. All suggest policy-makers increasingly recognize that renewables are cost-competitive and worth backing. 

Still, given the massive challenge of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, this year’s Climatescope offers a stark reminder of the work ahead. Rapidly growing nations that today are just as rapidly expanding their carbon footprints must reach net zero emissions by 2050. To get there, those currently leading the energy transition must keep growing their clean energy sectors while dormant renewable energy markets must also emerge.
Below is a synopsis of Climatescope 2019’s key findings by topic areas. 

### Capacity and generation

- **In 2018, developing nations added 201GW of new power-generating capacity to their grids with clean energy (non-large hydro renewables) accounting for just over half the total**. A total of 107GW of renewables were installed in emerging economies in 2018. 
- **The majority of the generation that will come from the new plants commissioned in 2018 will not be clean, however**. Due to wind and solar’s lower capacity factors than coal or gas, less than half the generation from these new plants will be zero-carbon.
- **Among the clean technologies, solar led the way with 66GW installed in 2018**, followed by wind with 29GW. Small hydro, biomass and geothermal combined saw 12GW added to emerging economies. Fossil fuel-fired capacity accounted for just a third of all new capacity added in developing nations in 2018. Large hydro and nuclear together account for 12% of the capacity installed.
- **Mainland China predominates. Two-thirds (71GW) of all developing nation clean energy capacity was installed in Mainland China in 2018.** Still, Mainland China clean energy capacity additions slipped 7% from the year prior. 
- **India is one of the world’s major clean energy players.** The country installed 14GW of wind and solar in 2018. While that was down from 15GW in 2017, India scored best on the Climatescope survey to finish top of the table for the first time. 
- **New construction of coal-fired power plants fell to its lowest level in a decade in 2018.** After peaking at 84GW of new capacity added in 2015, coal commissionings plummeted to 39GW in 2018. Mainland China accounted for approximately two-thirds of this.
- **Still, generation from burning coal in developing nations has jumped 54% since the start of this decade.** From 2017 to 2018 alone, it spiked 7%, the highest increase since 2013. In 2018, coal accounted for 47% of all power produced in developing economies.
- **Excluding Mainland China, new clean energy installations in emerging markets grew 21% and reached a new record, with 36GW commissioned in 2018, up from 30GW in 2017.** This is twice the clean energy capacity added in 2015 and three times the capacity installed in 2013.
- **Despite progress, the transition is not moving nearly fast enough to address the climate challenge.** In the 102 non-Mainland-China/India economies surveyed by Climatescope, just 38% of new 2018 capacity added was clean. In almost half the 83 markets that recorded capacity growth in 2018, fossil fuels represented the main technology type deployed.

### Investment

Capital inflows in support of clean energy power-generating projects tell a similar story. Like capacity additions, investment has been concentrated in traditional markets which saw significant drops in 2018. Meanwhile, a slew of new nations saw clean energy boomlets in 2018 and set new records for investment. 
- **In 2018, new clean energy financing for emerging markets totalled $133 billion, down from the peak of $169 billion in 2017.** Mainland China accounted for over two-thirds of the emerging markets total and was also responsible for the majority of the 2017-2018 dip in the headline figure. In all, $36 billion less flowed into Mainland China clean energy asset finance than in 2017.
- **Other major markets also saw steep clean energy investment drops.** India and Brazil, for instance, contributed to this global contraction by declining $2.4 and $2.7 billion, respectively from the previous year.  
- **Clean energy investment is spiking in many less traditional clean energy markets.** When excluding the three biggest markets (Mainland China, India and Brazil), clean energy investment jumped to $34 billion in 2018 from $30 billion in 2017. Most notably, Vietnam, South Africa, Mexico and Morocco led the rankings with a combined investment of $16 billion in 2018.  
- **The vast majority of clean energy capital deployed in emerging markets continues to come from local sources.** This is largely due to the heavy influence of domestic development banks and credit agencies in Mainland China and Brazil.
- **Foreign direct investment (FDI) supporting clean energy set a new record in 2018.** It jumped from $22.4 billion in 2017 to $24.4 billion in 2018. EU-based organizations remain the key foreign capital provider. 
- **Development banks represent the largest single foreign investor group and deployed a record volume of capital for clean energy in 2018.** These institutions, which include the World Bank and others, invested $6.5 billion, up from $4.5 billion in 2017. 
- **Italian utility Enel remains the top overall provider of capital to clean energy assets in developing countries with $7.6 billion invested to date.** The World Bank, Germany’s KfW and the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation remain familiar names in the top ranks of clean energy investors between 2009 and 2018.

### Growth drivers

What has dictated the pace of clean energy build and investment? Certainly, subsidies remain important drivers and markets have historically expanded or contracted as renewables-friendly policies have been rolled out or scaled back.

Subsidies are only part of the story, however. Today, two-thirds of the world’s population lives in a country where onshore wind, utility-scale PV, or both, is the cheapest option for new bulk generation. In those nations, wind, solar, and other projects are being built because they represent the cheapest option for the next marginal megawatt of capacity.

Still, this is not the case everywhere. In Turkey and in the nations of Southeast Asia, for instance, coal remains a low-cost option. That country and that region combined have built 35GW of coal since 2014. In many markets, the moment when building and operating a new renewable energy plant should, in theory, trigger the retirement of an existing fossil-fueled plant could take decades to arrive. Fast-forwarding to that juncture will be critical to limiting power sector emissions from these countries.

- **The cost-competitiveness of renewables in developing countries has historically been hampered by higher-priced domestic capital.** As renewable power projects are capital-intensive, the cost of finance available to project developers has historically resulted in  segregation between wealthy and less developed nations. In OECD countries, the benchmark weighted average cost of capital (WACC) BNEF tracked for wind and PV projects in 2017-18 ranged from 2.0-7.1%. In emerging economies, the benchmark ranged from 4.4-15%.

- **Lowering the cost of capital is one of the most effective ways to accelerate the crossover points between clean energy and fossil fuel-fired plants.** BNEF has identified that subsidized capital has the potential to substantially speed the transition from fossil-fuelled power generation to renewable energy in developing economies.
- **Policy action will be required in markets where newly built clean energy plants cannot yet undercut the economics of existing fossil plants on an levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) basis.** So far, Chile is the only emerging market where the government and utilities have made serious commitments to phasing out coal generation.
- **An unbundled power market open to private sector participation is the first step to attract clean energy investment.** Countries where power generation is managed separately from power transmission and distribution have attracted 94% of clean energy project investment into emerging markets over the past five years. 
- **Strong clean energy policies are also fundamental to facilitating renewable energy investment flows to emerging markets.** Auctions are the mechanism of choice to secure power contracts in nearly half of the emerging markets surveyed. Over the past ten years, these nations have awarded over 133GW of clean energy capacity in power purchase agreements (PPAs) via competitive auctions. One fourth of this was contracted in 2018 alone.

### Climatescope rankings

This year's Climatescope Emerging Market Outlook represents the collective effort of 45 BloombergNEF analysts who made 23 country visits to collect data and conduct interviews. Once again, the study has been graciously supported by the U.K. Department for International Development.

As in past years, Climatescope scored and ranked individual nations. While many of the countries that have appeared near the top of the survey's leaderboard in past years are there again this year, there have been some notable changes:
- **India is the top scorer in this year’s Climatescope survey.** The Asian nation’s aggressive policy framework and copious capacity expansions propelled it to first place in 2019, from second in 2018. The Indian market is home to one of the world's most ambitious renewable energy targets and has held the largest ever auction for clean power generation.
- **Chile dropped to second but scored higher than in the prior year.** Through strong clean energy policies and its commitment to phase out coal generation, Chile remains determined to transition to a cleaner matrix. In 2018, the country had 2.3GW of solar and 1.5GW of wind capacity online, representing 16% of total installed capacity.
- **Brazil rose to third from fourth last year.** Brazil has pioneered competitive auctions to contract clean energy, which led to over 28GW of renewable energy contracted 2009-2018. With the worst of its economic crisis now behind it and four auctions expected over the next two years, clean energy appears poised for renewed growth.
- **Mainland China ranks fourth in Climatescope, though the pace of clean energy investment growth there slowed dramatically in 2018.** A major policy revamp slowed wind and solar installations. Nonetheless, the country still scores highest of all Climatescope countries in terms of future clean energy development opportunities.
- **Kenya appears for the first time in the Climatescope top five.** The country is gradually increasing its share of non-large hydro renewables by adding solar, wind and geothermal. In 2018, Kenya recorded its highest ever clean energy investment with $1.4 billion. Kenya also accounted for over a third of all 2018 foreign investment into sub-Saharan Africa.
