State utilities have single-buyer status, so private-to-private power deals are largely off the cards. Dubai�s net-metering program presents the only real option for corporate players interested in procuring on-site renewables from a private third party. The initiative has been restricted in May 2020 as the maximum system capacity was capped at 2MW, a response to a host of large systems being applied for by hotels and manufacturers. Yet, by and large, policy has been but stable and risks relating to the offtaker, currency and land negligible."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"As in most of the region�s leading renewables markets, clean energy investment has varied considerably from year to year. New investment in renewables reached a record of $4.6 billion in 2019, and nearly all clean energy capital flows serve to finance solar projects. Local banks are playing an increasingly active role, notably by backing installations supported by Dubai�s net-metering program. Meanwhile, the consortia backing the country�s large-scale solar plants have drawn from a diverse capital pool. Credit providers range from local players like First Abu Dhabi Bank and the Mubadala Investment Company, to international lenders of the likes of Natixis and Mistubishi UFJ."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"The United Arab Emirates� flagship renewables target aims to achieve an electricity generation mix composed of 44% renewables, 38% gas, 12% �clean� coal and 6% nuclear. A federal target for a 24% renewables share by 2021 looms in the more immediate term � this is unlikely to be met. Meanwhile, the UAE�s federal structure affords emirates considerable autonomy in implementing their own renewables targets, incentives and procurement schemes. Abu Dhabi and Dubai have had considerable success in running large-scale, competitive auctions to procure solar power. However, success has been varied in certain areas. Abu Dhabi has, for instance, struggled to replicate the success of Dubai�s net-metering scheme even as it has proven its ability to pull off large-scale renewables auctions."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand has risen rapidly in recent decades, growing by nearly 10GW over 2010-19 to reach 25GW. The long-term impact of Covid-19 on demand will hinge on whether fears of a pandemic-induced expat exodus are borne out � foreign workers account for some 90% of the population. Regardless, favorable geography likely see more solar additions in the year to come, although there is a lack of visibility on tenders going forward. Yet much of the power fleet is relatively young. A high number of power purchase agreements for combined-cycle gas plants will come to an end in 2030 � many could be extended. Meanwhile, a transition toward less power-hungry reverse osmosis plants will contribute to decoupling the water and electricity sectors."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The UAE�s grid is fragmented among the various emirates, but gas remains the dominant form of power generation across the board. Representing 6% of installed capacity in 2019, renewables penetration is only just starting to ramp up. In the absence of a wholesale market, developers sell their power through take-or-pay contracts � their output is purchased regardless of demand. Independent power producers account for the majority of commissioned capacity, although the publicly owned utilities participate retain a major equity share in all projects. For its part, Abu Dhabi�s state utility � which is also active in the northern emirates � has been unbundled, although Dubai�s remains vertically integrated. Both retain single-buyer status, while generation is the only sector open to private participation."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Developers of solar utility-scale projects benefit from excellent irradiation levels, economies of scale and low development costs. Yet rock-bottom auction prices are also made possible by implicit subsidies, such as the fact that developers need pay for neither land nor a grid connection. Headline-grabbing bids have resulted, including a near-world record of $16.90/MWh recorded for Dubai�s latest solar auction in November 2019. Moreover, state utilities retain majority stakes in all utility-scale projects, reducing the cost of debt. Renewables are increasingly able to undercut fossil-fuel generators, for which fuel subsidies were removed in 2015. However, fossil-fuel generators continue to receive indirect support in the form of subsidized retail tariffs. For instance, residential prices have remained unchanged in Dubai over much of the last decade."}]}
