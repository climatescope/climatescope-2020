Efforts to rebuild international investor confidence are a work in progress, as the country continues to navigate macroeconomic and political crises. The current crisis are hurting the ability of projects to obtain financing, especially for the most recent auction, RenovAr Round 2, and RenovAr MiniRen 3. Constrained transmission and distribution networks will inhibit wind and solar build. While Argentina has taken important steps to foster its clean energy industry, important barriers remain."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"A scarcity of capital, price-distorting subsidies and political risk combined to make Argentina an unappealing destination for clean energy investment in the first half of this decade. That began to change in December 2015 with the arrival of President Mauricio Macri. Since then, Macri�s government sought to cut subsidies and liberalize energy markets to spur conventional and renewable project build underwritten with foreign capital. FODER, created under Macri�s administration, was backed by the World Bank, which provided guarantees of payments for the renewable tenders. The guarantees boosted confidence among foreign debt providers. Only then did Argentina begin to see financing in the sector, accounting for over $6 billion since 2016 and peaking in 2018 with $2.5 billion, a record for the industry in that country. Despite the recent progress, however, Argentina�s latest re-entry into macroeconomic crisis have pushed investors away and created difficulties for auction-winning projects that have yet to secure financing."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Argentina published in 2015 the Law 27.191, in which it implements incentives and targets for renewables. The law created the Trust Fund for the Development of Renewable Energies (FODER) and provided tax incentives such as a VAT tax rebate and accelerated depreciation. According to the law, Argentina should have met 8% of its power demand with clean sources in 2018. The country fell short, serving 2.5% of its demand with renewable electricity. The policy established a gradual increase in the target each year, reaching 20% by 2025."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Argentina�s clean energy investment has been affected by the recent macroeconomic and political crises. At risk is the financing of projects from RenovAr 2, which awarded contracts to 1.8GW of wind and solar assets. Additionally, the Ministry of Energy decreased considerably the amount of capacity tendered in 2019. RenovAr MiniRen 3 focused on small-scale projects and awarded only 259MW of clean energy projects due to transmission limitations. On the positive side, thanks to Resolution 281/2017, which obligates large consumers to meet renewables targets, the country has seen a significant increase in corporate PPAs to procure clean power."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Argentina�s power matrix remains largely reliant on thermal and large hydro assets. Currently, 50% of installed capacity is gas power plants, with hydro representing 27%. The country has a considerable amount of oil & diesel assets at 10% of the mix. Renewables share increased from 2.5% in 2017 to 7% by end-2019 thanks to the commissioning of projects awarded in RenovAr. The total capacity of wind and solar assets, less than 300MW in 2017, reached over 2GW by 2019. For the first time, wind became the largest source of renewable generation. Despite the dramatic increase in the technology, Argentina fell far short of its 12% renewables goal by year-end 2019. By then, only 6% of its generation came from small hydro, wind, solar and biomass."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Since Macri took power, electricity prices have spiked, as customer subsidies have been cut. Since 2015, industrial prices grew by 1,082%, while residential and commercial increased by 1,074% and 973% by end-2019, respectively. CAMMESA, the governmental market regulator, regulates tariffs and is also the offtaker for the RenovAr auctions. Auction bids dedicated to large-scale projects have consistently dropped in each round, averaging $59.6/MWh in the first, $54/MWh in the second, and $42.4/MWh in the last round."}]}
