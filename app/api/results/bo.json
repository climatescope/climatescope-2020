The nationalized energy sector and foreign companies also lack clear incentives to grow renewable capacity, and projects must be financed without the option of PPAs. There is no in-country manufacturing capacity for solar or wind components, so those technologies must be imported."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Development of clean energy projects in Bolivia is led by state-owned Empresa Nacional de Electricidad (ENDE), with investment coming from international development banks and the Central Bank of Bolivia. The role of solar generation solidified in 2018, as ENDE commissioned 65MW in Tarija and Potos� departments, a large increase compared to the 5MW project in Pando installed in 2015. A 50MW PV plant, financed by European development agencies, was also commissioned in Oruro in 2019. Bolivia�s first wind farm, Qollpana phase I (3MW) was commissioned in 2014 with a second phase (24MW) brought online in 2016. A pipeline of four wind projects, financed over 2017-18, may further the addition of 132MW of new capacity in the near term."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Bolivia has no comprehensive clean energy policy. Its National Development Plan 2017-2020 commits to a total installed capacity of 4.9GW by 2020, with a 1.4GW expansion in hydro capacity, 411MW of new wind, biomass, geothermal and solar and 1.1GW of new combined cycle and gas generation. At end-2019, the country had 3.6GW of total installed capacity and 249MW of renewables (excluding hydro). At November 2020, no new utility-scale projects had been commissioned and none were in the pipeline. In its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, Bolivia commits to a goal of increasing its share of �alternative� energy (wind, biomass, geothermal and solar) and other sources of energy (combined cycle) to 9% in 2030, up from 7% in 2017. In 2014, the country published Decree 2048 to encourage clean energy development."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Bolivia's energy reform prioritizes the electrification of rural areas, aiming for universal access by 2025. By consequence, demand for electricity is rapidly growing, rising 5% annually on average since 2010. However, in 2019 peak demand was flat compared to 2018, remaining at 1,512MW. Much rural electrification takes the form of off-grid projects, mainly relying on thermoelectric generators and solar photovoltaics. Business opportunities for renewables are on the rise after the first projects were commissioned in the past year. The largest planned projects are hydroelectric dams, as the country views them as the fastest way to achieve clean energy targets and increase exports to neighbors."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Despite the 800MW of new combined cycle gas turbines added in 2019, the share of natural gas generation in Bolivia�s power matrix has been declining. Government-subsidized pricing limits the competitiveness of renewables. However, Bolivia is seeking to expand its hydroelectric capability to 74% of capacity by 2025 (up from 30% in 2018) and allow the country to export electricity. Despite the subsidized competition from fossil fuel, renewable generation, such as from the Uyuni and Oruro solar plants, now accounts for 3% of total capacity. ENDE is responsible for most generation, transmission and distribution."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Bolivia's electricity prices are set by the government and, as Bolivia is a natural gas producer, dependent on heavily subsidized gas-powered generation. However, only 60.8% of the 9.5TWh generated in 2019 came from gas plants, compared to 72% in 2017 and 68% from 2018. The share of hydro generation increased from 28% to 34% and the share of solar generation increased from 0.1% in 2017 to 1.9% in 2019. Electricity prices continue to rise, although rates remain low compared to most countries in Latin America. In 2019, the average commercial electricity price was $167.12/MWh, while industrial and residential electricity prices were respectively $97.29/MWh and $119.96/MWh. Rates on average increased 1% from 2018 prices."}]}
