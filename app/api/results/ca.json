Offtake risk is low; PPA tenor is typically 20 years, which gives both offtakers and developers significant financial certainty. Canada also has transparent distributed energy resource grid interconnection standards for market certainty. Although there isn't much pressure to build new resources since hydropower is so plentiful and cheap, most provinces have shown interest in transitioning away from fossil fuels. The Canadian Wind Energy Association found that there exists only a modest amount of curtailment of wind energy. However, renewable curtailment is likely to increase as variable renewable penetration grows."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investment is focused around Canada's massive hydropower resources, and much of the country's clean energy policy reflects this hydro capacity. In the last decade or so, Canadian provinces have adopted various clean energy policies to increase the share of power from renewable resources and reduce emissions from the power sector. Any gaps in Canadaï¿½s renewable energy goals that aren't met with hydropower resources are filled by solar and wind resources, mostly by public utilities or large independent power producers. Thanks to transparent tariffs and energy data, investment in Canadian energy markets is diverse and competitive."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Canada's clean energy policy is mostly addressed on a provincial level. Each province controls its own electricity generation, distribution and energy market and sets its own clean energy targets. Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island have renewable energy goals. Manitoba, Ontario, and Newfoundland do not. In Manitoba and Newfoundland the majority of electricity generated comes from hydropower. Ontario had a renewable energy feed-in tariff that ended in 2017 and has the most installed wind (5GW) and solar capacity (3GW) in the country. Many Canadian provinces have vast quantities of pumped hydropower capacity, limiting the push to build out additional renewable energy or energy storage capacity."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Factors such as population growth, post-Covid-19 economic expansion and increasing use of electrical appliances and equipment are expected to drive Canada's electricity demand in coming years. Conversely, economic stagnation would suppress demand growth. In the first half of 2020, Alberta power demand averaged 4.9% below BloombergNEF's \"business-as-usual\" model, and Ontario was 1.6% lower. Given that the country is home to a modernized power grid with an 100% electrification rate nationally, the push for mini-grid systems is subdued and focused around smaller use cases, like remote regions or those with especially volatile grid connections."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"On a country-wide basis, hydropower supplies about 60% of total generation in Canada. As the country has not recently experienced the effects of droughts or other climate change-related natural disasters that could impact the output of hydropower resources, the dominance of hydro as a share of Canada's power mix is unlikely to change in the near term. Pumped hydropower resources provide necessary flexibility to provincial liberalized power markets, and about 35% of the country's power generation comes from inflexible thermal generating sources. There is little pressure to begin building significant battery resources. The biggest players in Canada's power markets are public utilities like Hydro-Quebec, Ontario Power Generation, and BC Hydro."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Average wholesale power prices in Canada are lower than those in the U.S., thanks in large part to the country's cheap and bountiful hydropower. The average annual wholesale price of power in Canada has remained below USD 20/MWh for the past five years. Retail pricing in Canada is dynamic; customers can choose from time-of-use (TOU) or tiered pricing schemes which assign a higher price of power when demand is highest. Dynamic pricing incentivizes retail customers to consume power when it is most efficient for the system to provide that power."}]}
