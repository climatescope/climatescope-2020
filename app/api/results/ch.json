The majority of investment is into solar, although there are signs this could change given the governments enthusiasm for hydro projects. Almost $4 billion has been provided to renewable energy projects in the country between 2014 and 2020. IWB Industrielle Werke Basel is by far the biggest lender to projects, at almost $10 million. Three companies each own more than 65MW of renewable projects. These are BKW AG, Elektrizitaetswerk der Stadt Zuerich and Repower AG."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"The Swiss Federal Council announced plans for renewable energy auctions at the end of 2019, but there is not yet any clarity on timelines or technologies. Switzerland provides feed-in premiums for renewables, which is financed by a special fund raised through a consumer surcharge of up to 23 Swiss francs ($25)/MWh. Historically, this program has mostly been used for solar project support. The Swiss Energy Act includes the target of adding 5,400GWh of additional renewable electricity on an annual basis by 2030 compared to 2000. Some 2,000 of the aforementioned 5,400GWh are to come from hydropower. The government is phasing out nuclear power, leaving open a capacity gap for renewables."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand in Switzerland is increasingly gradually. Peak demand was 5% higher in 2019 compared to 2018. Demand is increasing, yet power consumption has not varied significantly as improved efficiency has been enough to offset higher demand."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Hydro accounts for more than 60% of Switzerland's installed capacity, with nuclear accounting for the next biggest slice, followed by solar.  The shift away from nuclear, which makes up a third of total generation, will create a substantial gap in the mix, although the transition will not happen immediately. In 2017, voters rejected a scenario that would have had three of the country's five nuclear power plants close from 2017-2018. Instead, the Swiss Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate will determine how long the plants can operate safely and no new plants may be built."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Industrial and residential electricity prices increased between 2018 and 2019, by 3% and 1% respectively in Switzerland. Wholesale electricity prices fell by more than 20% in the same period, while commercial prices remained almost flat. Abundant hydro generation means that wholesale power prices in Switzerland are generally low relative to the EU average."}]}
