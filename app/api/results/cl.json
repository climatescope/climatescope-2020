Interconnection is critical for enabling solar energy, in particular, produced in the northern SING sub-system and home to the best solar resources, to flow to the center of the country, where population and demand are concentrated. Curtailment of renewables began in Chile in August 2015. Since then, wind and solar power had been curtailed at increasing rates, though progress is being made on development of new transmission infrastructure aimed at easing this. Currently the country has only two transmission lines connecting SIC-SING operating at full capacity. The government aims to increase the flexibility of the grid to allow for better integration of the renewable intermittent sources."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Chile attracted $16 billion of clean energy investment in the last seven years. In 2019 alone, the country registered a record of $4.9 billion, up four-fold on the previous year. The country was the second-largest market in the region in 201, overtaking Mexico. The country has many types of financial organizations investing in renewables, including development and commercial banks. The U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) has been the main lead arranger in the country. Although distributed PV generation expanded in 2019 (from 10MW in 2018 to 20MW in 2019), capacity is still in its infancy. In an attempt to boost distributed generation, the government expanded the size limit for installations from 100kW to 300kW in 2018."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Chile�s exceptional natural resources make it attractive to clean energy investment. The government has set ambitious long-term goals for adding clean energy capacity and begun implementing policies to foster an environment in which renewable projects are more competitive. Targets include a clean energy mandate of 20% of generation for utilities by 2025 and 60% of generation by 2035. According to BNEF�s methodology, the country had 22% of its power generated by clean sources in 2019 and 25% of clean energy installed capacity. Chile plans to auction a total of 5.9TWh/year in 2020, divided by time blocks. Auctions in Chile are technology-blind, with wind, solar, gas and other technologies competing head-to-head. In 2014, the government implemented a new system that created a more competitive environment for clean technologies. Since then, Chile has held four tenders and contracted 31TWh/year. In two of the last three tenders, renewables accounted for 100% of all generation contracted. In January 2018, coal plant owners signed an agreement committing to not invest in new assets. In 2019, the government announced a coal retirement plan that will phase-out 1.7GW by 2024. The plan is the first step of Chile�s decarbonization strategy, which aims to fully retire its coal fleet by 2040."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Chile is the world�s largest copper exporter, and the energy-intensive nature of that industry creates substantial power demand. The copper industry alone accounts for nearly half of Chile�s exports. In a given year, the mining industry consumes an average of 30% of the total power generated in the country. Mining operations are located in the northern part of the country and mostly served by the SING system. The majority of coal assets are also located in this region, in addition to the greatest potential for solar generation in the country. However, the lack of interconnection between SIC and SING has historically driven the majority of solar developments to the SIC system, where over 90% of the population lives and most of the retail demand is located. This reality might change, however, as the government increasingly focuses on integration of the two sub-systems and mining companies seek to procure clean power via bilateral power purchase agreements."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Chile has a National Electric System (Sistema El�ctrico Nacional, or SEN) as well as two smaller isolated systems in the south of the country, the Sistema El�ctrico de Ays�n (SEA) and Sistema El�ctrico de Magallanes (SEM). SEN was created with the connection of the country�s two primary power systems, the Sistema Interconectado del Norte Grande (SING) and the Sistema Interconectado Central (SIC), at the end of 2017. The process of interconnection continued and the country commissioned a second line connecting the two systems in June 2019. The SIC and SING sub-systems together account for 99% of Chile�s total installed capacity, with 18.4GW and 7GW installed, respectively. In 2019, Chile had 2.7GW of solar and 1.6GW of wind capacity, representing 18% of total installed capacity. While renewable power represented 22% of all energy generated. Wind and solar alone represented 14% of the country�s total power generation in 2019, up from virtually nothing five years ago."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"In Chile, spot prices are determined by the node of delivery, which takes into account the marginal operating costs of nodal plants as well as nodal demand. Spot prices have shown high volatility in recent years during the day. In 2018, spot prices slipped to zero at times during midday, while shooting back to $60/MWh at night. The same pattern was observed in previous years, but the situation has improved since with the interconnection of the country�s main power subsystems, SIC (Sistema Interconectado Central) and SING (Sistema Interconectado del Norte Grande). In 2019, after the commissioning of an important transmission line (Cardones-Polpaico) the spot prices across main nodes converged and decreased considerably, as clean and cheap power flowed into the system. Commercial, industrial and residential tariffs were stable in 2019 and averaged $222/MWh, $159/MWh and $196/MWh, respectively."}]}
