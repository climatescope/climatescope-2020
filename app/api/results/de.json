Local regulatory barriers, widespread litigation and a lack of available land have led to a crash in onshore wind installations in recent years. This has translated to a slump in auction participation. Several attempts have recently been made to tackle this issue, whether by reducing project exposure to court cases, or increasing financial incentives for host communities. The effectiveness of such measures remains to be proven. Meanwhile, policy has flip-flopped on a number of issues, such as whether subsidies for small-scale solar would be terminated in 2020 (they were not). Meanwhile, domestic manufacturers of solar modules have long been outcompeted by international suppliers, while more resilient wind turbine makers have announced a wave of redundancies."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investment has reduced in line with technology costs, but also due to difficulties in bringing onshore wind projects to financial close. Investment in onshore wind tumbled from $12 billion in 2017 to $3 billion and $2 billion in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Investment in solar has, for its part, remained stable over recent years. KfW, Germany�s development bank, is the largest provider of credit for clean energy projects, followed by Hamburg Commercial Bank and the European Investment Bank. Meanwhile, historic heavyweights such as RWE and EnBW top the rankings in terms of renewables capacity owned, with renewables-focused players like Enerparc and Orsted close behind."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"One of the world�s first movers in backing renewables, Germany�s support programs have shifted from feed-in tariffs to auctions for most utility-scale technologies. Over 90GW of renewables capacity is to be tendered over 2020-29, a similar volume to that installed as of 2019. Onshore wind auctions are suffering from a drop in participation, largely the result of permitting and acceptance issues. Innovation auctions, launched in September 2020, reward hybrid renewables projects and storage, while feed-in tariffs continue to support small-scale installations such as rooftop PV. Europe�s largest renewables market will have to continue growing to achieve a net-zero goal set for 2050. Germany also has ambitious targets for emissions, renewable consumption share and renewables capacity for 2030."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand has remained flat over recent years. Yet much uncertainty surrounds future electricity consumption, which could rise as a result of sectoral electrification. This is particularly relevant to such areas as green hydrogen production � in June 2020, the government set its sights on 5GW of renewable-powered electrolyzers by 2030. The closure of Germany�s coal plants by 2038 will offer additional opportunities for renewables as well as coal-to-gas conversions. That is especially relevant due to the government�s reluctance to subsidize new combined-cycle gas plants. Although strong winds benefit wind farms located in the north, they are often subject to curtailment. That is partly the result of congested transmission lines, although new cables being laid should alleviate this issue in the years to come."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Despite commissioning vast volumes of renewables, Germany continues to host Europe�s largest fossil fuel fleet. Renewables additions are set to rise with ambitious targets and a long-term auction timetable stretching out to 2030. However, difficulties commissioning onshore wind farms means that offshore wind and solar will have to pick up the slack. Over 40GW of coal and 30GW of gas was online in 2019 � a sizeable chunk of a 256GW power system. The electricity sector is fully unbundled and liberalized. Yet a handful of utilities such as RWE, Uniper and EnBW own a majority of generation assets. After remaining quiet over recent years, a handful of corporate deals indicates that the market for corporate power purchase agreements is heating up."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"German onshore wind, offshore wind and utility-scale PV sit in the middle of global LCOE ranges. Wholesale prices have become increasingly volatile as renewables penetration increases, leading to a marked rise in negative pricing events. How prices evolve will depend on the speed with which renewables continue to replace existing capacity � uncertainty in this area surrounds the speed of the country�s phase-out from coal as well as a protracted slump in onshore wind deployment. Retail power prices have been rising steadily, although industrial users benefit from a patchwork of favorable tariffs and exemptions. That has led to an uptick in residential supplier switching, which had long remained low by Western European standards � a result of the persisting influence of local suppliers."}]}
