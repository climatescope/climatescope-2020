However, the proposed rates did not fall as severely as expected in 2019. The country also faces a bottleneck with permitting for new renewable energy projects due to the very high volumes of applications. As of August 2020, more than 130GW of wind and solar projects have been granted grid access, while 117GW have had permission denied according to the system operator. According to Bloomberg's country risk assessment, Spain is a higher risk market than its mainland European counterparts, including Portugal (but lower risk than Italy), due to political and economic factors. In the past, a major barrier for small-scale renewables was the PV-plus-storage tax, which restricted financial compensation for feeding excess electricity to the grid. This barrier was removed in October 2018 by the government, and there has been a healthier pipeline of small-scale solar in Spain ever since."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Spain's clean energy sector attracted some $115 billion of investment from 2004-2019. Of this sum, almost half ($48 billion) occurred in the 2007-2008 boom period, owing to a generous subsidy scheme that benefited mainly onshore wind and solar developers. Investment declined substantially following the economic recession and the retroactive subsidy cuts for renewables, falling to just $200 million in 2016. The sector has since rebounded with the successful rollout of auctions and has attracted significant volumes of investment since 2017. Both onshore wind and PV reaching grid parity in 2018, becoming competitive on an unsubsidized basis given the average power price of that year. This sparked new investor interest in subsidy-free Spanish wind and solar projects. The biggest clean energy investor as of September 2020 has been Banco Santander, totaling more than $17 billion since 2004."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Spainï¿½s renewable energy market has bounced back since the era of retroactive cuts to renewables subsidies in 2013, which were passed due to a ballooning tariff deficit and overcapacity. Three auctions held between 2016 and 2017 awarded 4.6GW to onshore wind, 3.9GW to solar, and 200MW to biomass. Prior to this, by 2014, the feed-in tariff and premium schemes had been replaced with a 'regulated return on investment', under which a project was guaranteed 'reasonable profitability' and its returns were adjusted for wholesale power prices. The country is legally bound to its EU target of 20% renewable energy consumption by 2020. It is on course for having reached 18% in 2018, and has also set ambitious targets for 2030, including 42% renewable energy consumption and 74% renewables in electricity."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The three auctions held between 2016 and 2017 have demonstrated a resurgence in investor interest for Spain's abundant wind and solar resources. The business environment for renewable energy is positive in Spain as the market swings through its second boom. Much of the capacity secured in the auctions is exposed to merchant risk, having effectively bid for zero subsidy on the regulated return on investment. In 2017, the first corporate power purchase agreement was signed by a wind farm owned by EDP Renovaveis, a further example of Spain's merchant renewables market activity. Since then, BNEF has tracked a steady flow of corporate PPAs in Spain, with more than 1GW of wind and solar projects securing contracts between 2018 and 2020."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Spain's generating capacity has doubled since 2003 to reach 108GW in 2019, and is set to continue increasing in line with its renewables auctions. Today, more than half of the country's power generation is produced by nuclear and gas. But capacity additions over the last 10 years have been dominated by wind, hydro and solar - with renewables reaching 40% of generation in 2019. Spain's onshore wind market is more mature than solar, but BNEF forecasts indicate that more than half of new installed capacity in the country between 2020 and 2022 will be solar. Spain's regulation for balancing requirements is one of the most favorable to renewables in Europe. It has strict grid codes ensuring that generators meet technical standards and compensation (at 15% of wholesale prices) is available for any curtailment incurred in the spot market. In 2020, more than half of Spain's remaining coal capacity closed due to worsening economics and the unwillingness of generators to upgrade their power plants to meet emissions requirements."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Spanish electricity prices are higher than the European average, largely due to limited interconnections with the rest of the continent. This has exacerbated the grid overcapacity and reliance on the country's internal market to balance the power system. Given the collapse of coal generation, gas is now the dominant price setter in the power market. Power prices are also sensitive to hydropower availability, as seen in 2017 when drought conditions halved Spain's hydro power generation and prices reached new records. Low hydro output caused more expensive gas and coal generators to ramp up production to meet demand, alongside a rise in imported energy from France and Portugal. As higher volumes of utility-scale onshore wind and PV projects are commissioned, either as winners of auctioned capacity or unsubsidized projects, a long-term squeeze on the country's gas sector is expected. Higher volumes of zero-marginal cost renewable energy generation will also likely place significant downward pressure on power prices."}]}
