The country has been breaking down incumbent advantages in the retail sector. Distribution system operators were responsible for the smart meter rollout, which allowed the country to standardize smart meters in local regions. This made it easier for customers to switch retailers without their meters 'going dumb' and 11% of consumers now have dynamic tariffs tied to the wholesale price, which on average is 20% cheaper than standard tariffs. This has contributed to an annual switching rate of 14%. There are some constraints, however. A lack of sun during the winter makes it unlikely that large amounts of solar will be installed. Furthermore, the country is running out of premium onshore wind locations and the ease of the building permitting process varies somewhat between municipalities."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Finland attracted $9.5 billion of new clean energy investment over 2010-20, of which wind secured 59%. Wind capacity almost quadrupled since 2015, reaching 2.3GW by the end of 2019. Wind investments totaled over $2 billion in the past two years. The biomass and waste sector has also seen some investment, with more than $500 million invested in 2018. Finland is increasingly looking toward offshore wind as it is running out of suitable areas onshore. A 42MW pilot project of the world�s first offshore wind farm in icy winter conditions was commissioned in 2017."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Finland�s Energy Authority tendered 4TWh of capacity through a technology-neutral auction in 2018, which awarded seven wind farms with 12 year feed-in-premium contracts. No new auctions have been announced since. Until 2017, Finland offered a feed-in premium for wind and various bioenergy technologies. Utility-scale solar has not taken off, but distributed solar capacity reached 197MW in 2019. This is set to grow as legislative changes from 2021 make solar more attractive for blocks of flats. The government submitted a bill in October 2018 to ban the use of coal for energy, with a draft deadline of May 2029 for most plants. The government has agreed on a 90 million euro investment support scheme for plants that switch away from coal before 2025. Policymakers envision that nuclear will replace at least a part of the outgoing coal capacity, and two new reactors are expected to come online by 2022 and 2028. Small modular reactors for district heating are also being investigated."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The clean energy business environment is relatively positive, as the country is pushing to increase its renewables output. Finland achieved its 2020 target for 38% renewable energy consumption six years early and is planning on further tripling wind output and increasing solar output more than tenfold by 2030. Its coalition government pledged to carbon neutrality by 2035 in June 2019. As wholesale prices are low, corporate power-purchase-agreements have offered an opportunity for subsidy-free wind-projects in Finland. Despite the administrative burden of permits for wind farms, in January 2020 the permitting process had reached its final stages for onshore wind sites with potential for up to 7,500 MW additional capacity."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Nuclear remains the largest source of generation with a 35% share, with hydro at 19%. Finland is a part of Nord Pool and benefits from low-cost electricity imports from Sweden. It also imports cheap power from Russia and recently reduced tariffs on Russian electricity imports, which paves the way for increased imports. In 2019, Finland imported around 23% of its total electricity consumption. Low power prices have slowed down wind projects in neighboring Sweden, but Finnish projects have been protected by the above-market feed-in-premium. In addition, Finnish wholesale prices in 2019 were on average 15% higher than in Sweden. Finland has implemented a strategic reserve to guarantee security of supply with 611MW capacity for July 2020 through June 2022."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Finnish wholesale power prices are below average compared to other EU countries. The average baseload day-ahead price for 2019 was 44.2 euros/MWh. This is because Finland generates more than 50% of its power from technologies with low short-run marginal costs like hydro and nuclear. However, the country is more dependent on fossil fuels than other Nord Pool countries, meaning its wholesale price tends to be higher than its neighbors�. Finland's average household retail price in 2019 was 173 euros/MWh, putting it slightly above its fellow EU member states. However, when adjusted for purchasing power the tariffs are among the lowest in Europe."}]}
