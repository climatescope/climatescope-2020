Non-Ghanaian companies that were already operating since before December 2017 have a grace period of five years to comply with the rule. Ghana offers import duty and VAT exemption on PV equipment, but it requires PV modules to be packaged together when they are brought into the country. Importers also report that the tax exemptions are not applied consistently and one solar company told BNEF that it pays higher import duties in Ghana than any other West African country. For utility-scale renewables, offtaker risk remains the biggest barrier as the government canceled or deferred approved renewables PPAs in 2018. Amid the oversupply of generation capacity today, Ghana is unlikely to support more renewables in the near term."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The majority of investment in renewable energy in Ghana has come from foreign sources, with the largest commissioned solar project (20MW) financed by Chinese investors. More recently, a couple of onsite solar projects for commercial companies have been financed, including one for drinks company Kasapreko, and another financed by an impact investor at a recycling plant. German development bank KfW is also financing 17MW of solar, scheduled to come online in December 2020. The government is unlikely to approve new utility-scale projects under the feed-in tariff scheme due to the current oversupply situation. Distributed-solar startups have also attracted some investments. These include PEG Africa, a pay-as-you-go solar company, and Redavia, an on-site solar financer and developer."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Ghanaï¿½s government originally set a target of 10% renewable energy generation in the energy mix by 2020, but has since extended the target to 2030. The country has excess power generation capacity compared to demand, which reduces the incentive for the government to authorize IPPs to build new power projects. The current low level of renewable energy penetration is therefore unlikely to increase significantly in the near future. State-owned companies currently receive priority for building new solar projects. In theory, a feed-in tariff program exists today, but developers are unlikely to be able to access it currently."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand in Ghana has been growing, with peak demand reaching 2,783MW in 2019, up 10% from 2018. The heaviest power consumers are the 51 companies registered as bulk customers (as of August 29, 2019). These entities have a peak demand of at least 500 KVA for a consecutive period of three months or a minimum annual energy consumption of 1GWh. Many of these are concentrated in the Tema Export Processing Zones, which is authorized by the government to promote industrial activities. The extractive industry is also a heavy power consumer, accounting for about 10% of total power demand in Ghana. The national electrification rate reached 84% in 2018, which is one of the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, electrification rates as reported by government are not always accurate because many households may not have electricity access even if the grid extends to their area. Political focus is on extending the grid as opposed to electrification via other means such as solar home systems."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The generation sector has several independent power producers operating plants together with state-owned companies such as Volta River Authority (VRA). State-owned Ghana Grid Co. (Gridco) is the sole company that owns and operates the transmission system. Distribution is carried out by the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG), the Northern Electricity Distribution Co. (Nedco) and Enclave Power Co. In 2019, some 68% of generation was sourced from oil and gas, and 30% was from hydro. The small remaining proportion came from two utility-scale PV plants, and there is little prospect of new projects in the near future due to the oversupply in generation. The market for commercial offtake is developing, however, with a couple of recent PPAs signed, such as one for the 225MW Ayitepa wind farm that is being developed by Lekela."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Ghana has some of the highest power prices in the region, due to an inefficient transmission and distribution system with high losses, PPAs with expensive thermal generation and a failure to effectively collect revenue. As a result, power prices increased through the mid-2010s, and became one of the main focuses of the 2016 election. In March 2018, the new government cut the electricity tariffs for industrial customers by as much as 30%, and the reductions were also extended further to residential and commercial customers. The new tariffs are not reflective of the cost of generation and transmission, and so are heavily subsidized. Despite the reductions, the tariffs are still one of the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa."}]}
