Still, permitting bottlenecks are keeping the market from accelerating in line with investor interest. The government is taking steps to bring the permitting process down to under 2 years. Local opposition to wind projects has also been problematic. In 2017, the 154MW Kafireas wind farm was delayed for more than six months after a local environmental group challenged the validity of the project's environmental permit. Streamlining the permitting process while engaging with local interests will be a challenge as Greece aims to accelerate renewables deployment."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"From 2012-2019, Greece attracted $4.7 billion in new clean energy investment. The country�s initial renewables boom was concentrated around solar, but retroactive subsidy cuts in 2014 saw PV investment plunge to near zero, where it remained until a 2.5GW PV project reached financial close in October 2020. Between 2015 and 2019, just 2% of new investment went to PV. The country's top lead arrangers for renewables over 2015-19 were Greek banks Alpha Bank and Eurobank Ergasias, though the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development also continue to play an important role in de-risking the sector in the aftermath of the 2014 subsidy cuts."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Greece procures renewables capacity through an auction program that awards a feed-in premium. Since the program was launched in 2018, more than 2.5GW of wind and solar projects have been awarded. The country has met its 2020 target of 18% renewables in final energy consumption in 2018. Greece is increasing its ambition toward 2030, with a targeted share of 65% for renewables in electricity generation. The country will need to rapidly expand the policy framework to double the share of renewables in electricity generation over the next decade. An almost-total lignite phase-out by 2023 and increasing interconnection of the country�s island systems can offer growing opportunities for renewables deployment."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Robust wind and solar resources have driven interest in Greek renewables, though electricity demand has fallen due to the economic crisis and now Covid-19. The transmission system operator is working to extend the grid to the islands, which host some of the best wind and solar sites, with capacity factors for the former reaching 30% in some locations. But highly seasonal power demand on the islands means that development of these sites makes economic sense only if the power can be transported to the mainland. Other islands have also been selected for the development of pilot hybrid mini-grid systems."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The Greek power system is still dominated by Public Power Corp (PPC), the former state monopoly that owns the country�s lignite and hydro assets. As part of Greece�s bailout deal with its European creditors, PPC was to sell off 40% of its lignite capacity, but no buyers were found and in September 2019 the prime minister announced Greece would phase out all lignite production by 2028, with all but one plant to close by 2023. A flexibility mechanism to reward ramping capacity is under discussion, and at least two new combined-cycle gas turbine plants of around 800MW each are in the works to ensure security of supply as lignite � which made up almost a third of generation in 2018 � leaves the system."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The exposure of the Greek power sector to rising carbon prices has driven the country�s wholesale power price up, and prices are volatile due to highly seasonal demand fuel price fluctuations. Full liberalization of the power market in line with the European �target model� has been delayed repeatedly but is set to be complete by October 2020. Retail prices are also high, as ratepayers subsidize higher costs on the non-interconnected island systems. Growing renewables penetration, increasing interconnection, and falling lignite generation exert downward pressure on power prices. Onshore wind and utility-scale PV are increasingly competitive with new gas, driving growing interest in renewables development. Competition in auction rounds is heating up and continuing to push prices down. Full market liberalization will finally allow developers to enter bilateral contracts directly with offtakers."}]}
