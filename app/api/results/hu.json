In particular, several laws restrict the number of sites that can be used for wind turbines, and administrative barriers make licensing a wind farm essentially impossible. These barriers are driven by concerns around network balancing and landscape disturbance, and they have prevented the growth of Hungary's wind sector. In addition, under Metar, the premium awarded covers only the return on investment, not operating costs, and that for plants above 0.5MW, operators are responsible for grid balancing, thus increasing curtailment risk. It is also notable that the government introduced a levy of 114 forint ($0.38) for each kilogram of solar panel in order to deal with waste from discarded panels. This charge constitutes roughly 6% of the price of solar cells in the country. The history of government intervention in the power sector will also likely hinder investment."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The introduction of the Metar renewables program led to substantial growth in solar investment, with about $1.6 billion invested between 2018 and July 2020. The most active investors in Hungary's renewables market are Enlight Renewable Energy, Erste Group Bank, and Greentech Hungary, all of which financed megawatt-scale new solar portfolios in 2018 and 2019. Some of these projects have been commissioned, and BloombergNEF forecasts indicate that at least 750MW of PV will be installed from 2018 to 2020. However, Metar has already hit a bump in the road: In May 2018, the government unexpectedly introduced a deadline for projects below 0.5MW that sought the feed-in tariff option, causing many small-scale PV projects to miss the application window. Policy uncertainty under a historically interventionist government could resurface as a deterrent for investors."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Hungary held its first renewables tender in 2019, supporting large-scale projects of over 1MW again, after it suspended its feed-in tariff (KAT) for new renewables projects above 0.5MW at the end of 2016. A new support program (Metar) was introduced in 2017, allowing new renewable projects of 0.5-1MW to receive a feed-in premium and sell on the wholesale market. Projects between 50kW and 0.5MW are still eligible for the KAT feed-in tariff, but PV applications for this category ended in May 2018. Wind power is not eligible for the Metar feed-in premium, and restrictions on building locations make support for wind very unlikely, although it is officially allowed to participate in tenders. The government has also introduced net metering for plants below 40kW, and has expanded its incentives for electric vehicle uptake. The country was the first EU member state to ratify the Paris Agreement, but progress on increasing renewables has been somewhat limited by its focus on nuclear. Hungary reached 16% renewables in 2013, above its 2020 EU clean-energy target of 13%, but the share has declined since. Hungary�s clean-energy target for 2030 is 21%, notably below the overall EU target of 32%."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Solar PV is expected to continue its recent growth supported by the Metar tenders, as Hungary aims to increase its share of renewable electricity from 8% in 2018 to 21% in 2030. An increasing amount of electricity is traded according to market principles, and the volume of electricity sold on the wholesale market grew 12% from 2018 to 2019. Electricity demand in Hungary (a former Soviet republic) fell substantially since the 1990s owing to the collapse of heavy industry. Demand has yet to recover fully, and it experienced another fall after 2008 in the wake of the global financial crisis. From 2015 to 2019, demand slowly recovered, growing 1-2% per year. The government has somewhat reversed the liberalization of the country's power market. In 2016, it took steps to renationalize the sector, with the national utility company ENKSZ acquiring stakes in EDF Demazs as well as regional electricity distributors owned by RWE. ENKSZ was renamed NKM in 2017 and is owned by the MVM group. However, not only government-owned players have increased market concentration -- in 2019, E.On acquired two of the country�s distribution networks and reached a distribution market share of 79%."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Nuclear plants generate one-half of Hungary's electricity, gas and coal combine to provide one-third. Renewables, mainly biomass and wind, deliver the rest. Hungary is highly dependent on energy imports, mainly from Russia � a trend that the EU wants to limit. As a result, the European Commission gave approval for two new nuclear reactors at the Paks site, with a total capacity of 1.2GW, potentially limiting the opportunity for renewables. Both generation and retail markets are highly concentrated. State-owned MVM�s market share in generation grew from about 40% in 2010 to almost 60% in 2019, and Hungary has among the lowest number of electricity suppliers in the EU � only three, despite a population of almost 10 million."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Hungary has relatively low retail power prices compared to its neighbors. While electricity prices for non-household customers increased in 2018 and 2019, the regulated household electricity prices have stayed at 30% below the average EU residential tariffs. Over 90% of households are on government-regulated tariffs. Tariffs fell substantially in 2013, when the government imposed a 20% reduction in regulated residential electricity prices, at the expense of power companies. Prices are still below cost, forcing utilities to cover the difference. The European Commission has repeatedly asked the government to enforce fully the energy directives and to adjust tariffs to reflect costs. For instance, in July 2018, the EC took Hungary to court over the exclusion of certain costs in electricity tariffs. Hungary's average household retail price in 2018 was 112 euros/MWh, putting it almost half below its fellow EU member states (208 euros/MWh). The electricity bill for households in Hungary decreased the most (-27%) among EU countries."}]}
