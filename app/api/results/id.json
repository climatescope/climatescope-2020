Solar modules and wind turbines are exempt from these rules. However, there are varying levels of local content requirements for other components, including local services. The lack of availability of local equipment and skilled workforce makes these legal requirements difficult to meet. Project development costs are also higher than in neighboring markets due to inconsistent tax incentives and high property prices that make it harder for renewable developers to undercut the costs of existing generation. Further, the Indonesian rupiah has seen high volatility against the U.S. dollar, which is a concern for foreign players if the project revenue or costs are in local currency. Developers also have to engage with multiple government agencies at the local and national level, which often delays projects. PLN, the single offtaker of power from all the grid-connected power plants, is highly reliant on government subsidies to stay afloat, which increases credit risk."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Indonesia has seen very limited investment in solar and wind power since 2015. These two technologies accounted for less than a quarter of all new clean-energy investments in the country during 2015-19. Geothermal power projects constitute the majority of clean-energy investments. Vena Energy commissioned two solar power projects with a cumulative capacity of 28MW in 2019 � the only new utility-scale renewable energy projects commissioned that year. There is interest from commercial banks to participate in the renewables market but their involvement has been limited due to lack of investment-grade projects."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Indonesia aims to generate 23% of its total electricity from new and renewable energy sources by 2025, up from 7% in 2019. New and renewable energy sources, however, also include technologies like nuclear, hydrogen, coal bed methane, gasified coal and liquefied coal. Nevertheless, this target is ambitious, given the low levels of finance committed to renewables in the recent past. The Electricity Supply Plan (RUPTL) 2019 sets goals to add 6.1GW of hydro, 4.6GW of geothermal, 4.1GW of solar, 3.5GW of pumped storage and 1.7GW of other renewables over 2019-28. New solar and wind projects are to be awarded through a limited tender process. Bid prices are restricted to 85% of the regional generation cost, if it exceeds the national average. If the regional cost is less than the national average, tariffs can be negotiated between the national utility Perusahaan Listrik Negara (also known as PLN) and the developer. The process to participate in the tender is not clear, and there is little clarity on the template of the power purchase agreement. These policies have increased risks and have rendered renewable energy projects less attractive to investors."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand in Indonesia is not increasing as expected by the country�s policy planners. Economic growth rates were high during 2010-12, and electricity demand increased at an annual rate of 8-9%. Annual demand growth has slowed since 2014 to 4-5% due to lower-than-expected GDP growth, forcing the government to cut its power capacity expansion plans. The government reported 99% of all households as electrified in 2019, up from about 64% in 2010. In the medium term, there is a huge potential to develop clean-energy microgrids in Indonesia as the country has about 5GW of oil and diesel power generators providing electricity in the remote regions. Replacing diesel power with a combination of solar and battery storage could decrease generation costs as well as emissions. Indonesia receives relatively good sunshine throughout the year, and therefore offers significant opportunities for large- and small-scale solar power projects in the long term. The country does not currently have any official power plant fleet modernization programs."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The power market in Indonesia is semi-unbundled: private players can participate only in generation, and accounted for 37% of the installed capacity in 2019. System operation, transmission and distribution are controlled by PLN, which is the sole offtaker. Private developers are not allowed to sign direct power purchase agreements with consumers. Corporate users may procure renewable power only through on-site PV systems, which can be purchased upfront or leased. Indonesia�s power mix is dominated by fossil fuels, which accounted for 85% of the installed capacity in 2019. The share of coal has increased from 36% to 50% of the installed capacity during 2010-19 to meet the rapid rise in electricity demand. Renewables� share has grown only marginally due to lack of support from the government."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Power prices in Indonesia are one of the lowest in the region: at $77-90/MWh for commercial and industrial users in 2019, and $78/MWh for households. The government subsidizes retail electricity tariffs. A subsidy is given directly to the national utility PLN to cover its electricity supply costs. The government has not changed electricity prices in 2018 and 2019. The levelized cost of solar and wind power is still not competitive with conventional generation technologies like coal and hydro in Indonesia, due to the limited overall deployment in the country and the high cost of finance for these projects."}]}
