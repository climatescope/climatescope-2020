The government has just begun supporting renewables again with its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme, after a few years with no support following the end of Ireland's feed in tariff in 2015.  Public opposition and potential planning challenges may be the biggest barrier for project developers, particularly for onshore wind."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Renewable energy investment is mostly in wind technology, although there have been some sporadic investments into biomass and waste. Investment in renewable energy peaked in 2015, at $1.2 billion. Investment in 2019 reached $0.6 billion. Norddeutsche Landesbank-Girozentrale is the biggest backer of renewable projects in Ireland, committing more than $1.5 million. SSE Plc owns the biggest share of renewables projects, accounting for 548MW. Irelandï¿½s first round of its new renewable energy auction scheme brought a surprisingly strong result for solar projects."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Ireland is committed to producing at least 16% of all energy consumed from renewable sources by 2020. It aims to meet this target through 40% renewable electricity, 12% renewable heat and 10% renewable transport. The country had its first round of auctions for renewable energy projects in June 2020, wherein results showed a strong turnout for solar projects. The next round will be held in 2021. Ireland has a net metering scheme, within which renewable energy is given priority grid access. It is phasing out coal plants, as well as oil and gas exploration projects."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Peak demand has remained relatively stable over the last ten years, with year-on-year change not fluctuating by more than 2% in any given year. Ireland is expected to be a key market for corporate power-purchase agreements (PPAs) in Europe."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Ireland may still rely on fossil fuels (in particular gas) for more than two thirds of its power generation. But intermittent renewable technologies have one of the biggest shares of the generation mix in Europe, thanks to an influx of onshore wind capacity in the last decade. Its reliance on gas imports is set to rise to 85% by 2025. Its power market was liberalized in 2005, although it remains dominated by the former monopoly (ESB) and its many subsidiaries."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Average commercial, industrial and residential electricity prices declined by 2%-4% between 2018 and 2019. Meanwhile, wholesale electricity prices increased by almost 20% between 2018 and 2019. Looking back five years, electricity prices have all fallen steadily. Commercial, industrial and residential electricity prices fell by 13%-15% between 2014 and 2019. Ireland has relatively high retail electricity prices for households and industry compared with the EU average. This is likely caused by caused by the country's reliance on fossil fuels for power generation and fuel imports."}]}
