As power demand is expected to fall due to shrinking population and slowdown in economy, opportunity for new capacity addition is very limited except for replacement of retired old capacities. Coal and gas accounts for 68% of generation while growth in solar capacity expected to be the largest in 2020. We expect 7GW of capacity to be added this year. Japan has 10 different power markets and each region is poorly connected, resulting in price distortion between east and west regions in wholesale market."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Power retail price has been rising despite the retail deregulation in April 2016, due to the slow restart of nuclear reactors, generous feed-in tariff rates and growing renewables.

Capex and opex may fall to some extent but not enough to reach global average."}]}
