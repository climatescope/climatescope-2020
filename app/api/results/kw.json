The government is striving to attract foreign investment as a way to grow the local economy, create jobs, and promote technology transfer. However, the effort to grow the share of renewables in generation lacks a consolidated approach. Moreover, as the liberalization of the power sector nor the removal of power-price subsidies seem likely in the foreseeable future, this could be a hindrance to new market entry of IPPs."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investment in Kuwait has been limited to single deals in the past five years, with the deployment of renewables starting in 2016. No other renewable energy technologies aside from solar or wind are set to be developed, but some hybrid projects are in planning. The country does not have financial institutions solely dedicated to green investments, but domestic banks have been active in financing renewable energy projects. Increasing capacity is funded through the private-public-partnership (PPP) model. For example, the Az-Zour North Power and Water plant uses the PPP model to secure financing."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Kuwait's 2030 Energy Strategy sets out to secure 15% of electricity generation from renewable energy sources by 2030. Even though the power mix remains largely hydrocarbon-based, progress has been made in the past years with the deployment of solar (both PV and solar thermal) and onshore wind projects. Aside from this target, Kuwait uses tenders to support more large-scale projects. However, the major project in the pipeline, the 1.5GW Al-Dabdaba, seems to have been scrapped due to Covid-19. The development of renewable energy is in line with the country�s overall goal of freeing up fossil fuels for more value-added sectors like oil refining and petrochemicals, which makes the policy more likely to be stable and consistent."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand has steadily grown at 3% per year on average since 2015, with power consumption per capita among the highest in the world. This is the result of several factors, namely wasteful resource consumption on the back of heavily subsidized energy prices, population growth, and a nascent petrochemical industry. Kuwait�s abundant solar and wind resources offer the potential for a quick ramp up of renewable power. Although no explicit fleet modernization program has been announced, Kuwait is building capacity in response to the forecasted growth in electricity demand."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Fossil fuels account for the vast majority of Kuwait�s power generating capacity. The country has increased the share taken by gas-fired power plants in the past years, and will continue to do so in the future. Despite the commissioning on PV, solar thermal and onshore wind projects in recent years, renewable energy still accounts for less than 1% of total capacity. All segments of the power sector remain under the governance of the Ministry of Electricity and Water."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Consumption of energy is heavily subsidized in Kuwait. Electricity prices are among the lowest in the Middle East. These subsidies distort the allocation of resources by encouraging excessive consumption, accelerating the depletion of natural resources and undermining the growth potential of renewables. This results in one of the highest per capita energy consumption rates in the world. The government increased electricity prices for the residential (expatriates only) and commercial sectors in Kuwait in 2017. However, electricity prices are much lower than the cost of generation, and the subsidy level is still very high even after the price increase. There�s more to be done to encourage rational use of electricity and investment in the renewable sector."}]}
