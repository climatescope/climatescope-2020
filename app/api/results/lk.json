In terms of projects development, the electricity act of Sri Lanka requires that the government should hold at least 50% share or certain shares that determined by the Treasury and Ministry of Finance, which could potentially set barriers for both domestic and international investors. A host of pilot projects described as \"exotic technologies\" are in the pipeline: large-scale battery storage, ocean energy, small wind power vertical-type systems and hybrid power systems combining solar, wind and battery. Though the aspirational target of 100% clean energy is often cited, the fact is that new coal plants are part of the new long-term energy plan."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Large portion of Sri Lanka�s solar and wind projects are financed by domestic banks including DFCC banks, Hatton National Banks and so on, as domestic investors are more willing to accept the small scale of non-conventional renewable energy (NCRE) projects and the risk allocation under the PPA. These small size projects up to 10MW has been attracting private investment from local developers. However, multilateral lenders like Asia Development Bank (ADB), World Bank and International Finance Corporation (IFC) are also playing significant roles in the clean energy investment in Sri Lanka especially in large utility scale projects that require lots of capital, lending funds and providing technical assistance in power sector reforms, renewable energy development and etc. ADB supports the development of a 100MW wind farm in Mannar Island as well as the Rooftop Solar Power Generation Project back in 2017."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Sri Lanka approved a long-term electricity generation plan (2020-2039) last year which includes new coal plants to be commission starting 2023, the preferred option of the utility Ceylon Electricity Board, and also envisages new gas and renewable energy plants, which is what the regulator Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka or PUCSL favored. The new generation plan increased the proportion of renewables and decreased the proportion of coal slightly, while doubling gas capacity compared to the last plan submitted in 2018. New gas turbines are expected to come online since 2021, which indicates that gas might be what the country would settle for to balance interests of different parties. Solar capacity installation and generation grow faster than wind in Sri Lanka, which benefit from the net metering policy on rooftop installations."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand growth in last five years averaged 5.0%. Looking forward, CEB expects the demand will continue to grow at a five-year average growth of 6.0%. Unlike any other country in South Asia, Sri Lanka already achieved 100% electrification. New power plants are required to meet growing demand, and also to balance retirements. Rooftop solar is a bright spark in renewable energy in the country. The availability of a net metering scheme coupled with high tariffs means that more and more rooftops are aiming for solar installations. Import of equipment for renewable energy including solar panels and storage batteries, etc. will be exempted from the national building tax (NBT) and as well as the ports and airport levy (PAL)."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Sri Lankan�s power market still has a long way away from liberalization. Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the dominant utility, is yet to be unbundled, and seems to hold counterviews with the regulator PUCSL on the long-term generation expansion plan. CEB is the biggest player in the generation market and the only transmission licensee, which makes the reform in power supply industry hard to proceed. In the current energy mix, thermal oil accounts for the second largest portion in installed capacity, and coal most likely became the first in generation in 2019. The PUCSL has not announced any retail tariff revisions since 2014. CEB has not been able to make a convincing case for tariff revision, transparently laying out its power procurement and power sales. The country hasn�t implemented any battery storage into the grid system but has an ambitious goal. Sri Lanka's grid is isolated � having no connections with any of its neighbors yet � which also impacts future planning."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"In general, Sri Lanka has among the highest tariffs in the world for residential users (45 rupees/ 28 U.S. cents), which partly explains the rapid uptake of rooftop solar in households. The current tariff structure for different types of end-users are cross-subsidized. For example, households that consume below a certain amount of monthly consumption standard will be subsidized from payment from commercial customers and high-user households. The country also subsidizes low-voltage household customers by charging increased tariffs from large industrial consumers and hotels. Tariffs have not been revised since 2014."}]}
