Renewable energy auctions should help to drive capacity installations through 2025. As retail electricity prices are low, incentives to install residential solar panels are not as high as in other countries, but the rebate scheme that is set to run until 2023 is likely to make the investment more attractive. The synchronization to the European grid by 2025 remains a challenge."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Lithuania attracted around $1.2 billion of clean energy investment between 2010 and 2020. Wind accounted for almost half of that total, although from 2016-2017, investment was dominated by biomass, which attracted $621 million. Lithuania's top lead arranger for renewables has been the European Investment Bank, which has been responsible for $204 million, around a third of the country�s total. The largest projects in the past five years have been carried out by Ignitis Group, which invested 205.6 million euros in waste-to-energy CHP plants in Vilnius and Kaunas, with the support of a loan from the European Investment bank. Lithuania�s first large subsidy-free wind farm of 69MW secured financing from GE Capital and E Energija in August 2020."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Lithuania achieved its 2020 target of 23% renewable energy in total electricity supply ahead of schedule � reaching 25.8% in 2017. The role for renewables is set to increase, with the target for 2030 now at 45%. The country�s first renewables auction was held in September 2019, where a 75MW wind farm was awarded a zero-subsidy contract and dispatch priority. The auction scheme will run from 2020 to 2022 with a total budget of 385 million euros ($20 million). Offshore wind auctions are planned for 2023. Lithuania has ambitious plans for what it calls 'prosumers'. These small-scale solar installations will receive a boost from a solar rebate scheme of 17 million euros, as well as from net-metering or sliding feed-in-tariffs for small-scale (up to 10kW in capacity) renewable projects. Low-emission transport has few incentives in Lithuania compared to other EU countries, although a 2020 scheme enables companies to apply for investment support for low-emission vehicles. Lithuania plans for 80-90% of heat to be produced from renewables by 2030."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Lithuania's renewable energy market continues to be driven by the EU Renewables Directives' 2020 targets, as the country seeks to help other member states meet their shortfall with its excess renewables. A statistical transfer agreement was signed in October 2017 whereby Lithuania will transfer its renewable energy surplus from 2018-2020 to Luxembourg. The deal will bring it 10 million euros, which will be invested in new renewables projects and research, according to the Ministry of Energy. Lithuania is looking to set up a capacity market by 2025 and so submitted draft regulation for capacity auction procedures for public consultation in July 2020. Renewables capacity, generating a total of 21TWh annually, can be awarded feed-in-premiums through auctions in 2020-2022. The 2020 auctions for premiums up to 3.02 euros was undersubscribed and the quota was instead moved to later auctions."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"In 2019, the share of renewable electricity reached 21% and some 62% of renewable electricity was generated by wind power plants. The share of gas in the generation mix increased slightly to 13% from 10% in 2018, but significantly decreased from 42% five years earlier. Lithuania�s wind and biomass & waste sectors have expanded. The country has met its 2020 capacity targets of 500MW of wind capacity, 224MW of biofuels and 10MW of solar. Renewable electricity should account for 45% of consumption, according to Lithuania�s 2030 target. Distributed solar is available to residents of apartment blocks through a remote purchasing scheme, made possible by way of the �Solar Community� online platform in March 2020. Plans for offshore wind are progressing in 2020, with a site in the Baltic Sea, supporting 700MW of capacity, having been selected. In 2018, the Baltic States and Poland signed an agreement to decouple their electricity systems from the Russian power grid, and to instead synchronize with the EU by 2025. This should help them to balance and integrate an increasing proportion of intermittent renewables."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Retail electricity prices in Lithuania are relatively low compared to the EU average. However, new power interconnections with Poland and Sweden are to be commissioned in 2023 and could affect price dynamics. Residential tariffs are still regulated and are among the lowest in Europe, although a gradual deregulation is planned for 2021-2023. Lithuania has implemented generous investment incentives to convince consumers to install their own renewables systems."}]}
