New government regimes and turnover have led to lags and contributed uncertainty to the outlook for new solar and wind projects. There is also an unstable legal and regulatory regime alongside lacks of transparency on prices and other issues. Some of these have been diminished by the country�s efforts to join the European Union and expand renewable energy offerings in support of that objective. Power purchase agreements are of sufficient duration, and offtaker risk is minimal. Additionally, curtailment is not a problem."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"North Macedonia relies heavily on lignite for its electricity, along with large and small hydro. To a much lesser extent, solar PV, onshore wind, and biomass have been added, but together they make up a small portion of total energy generation. However, auctions for wind power have arisen recently, in addition to those for solar PV. Procedures in the region regarding renewable energy development are still complex and nascent, which has led to uncertainty and investment concerns. However, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has lent to the state-owned electric company to transform a sidelined coal power plant into a solar operation; furthermore, Germany�s KfW has played an important role in financing wind power in the country."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"In 2019, North Macedonia drafted three energy scenarios in a Strategy for Energy Development. These focus on improving energy efficiency and expanding renewable energy to varying degrees with a look forward to 2040. The moderate and green transition scenarios both align with a coal phase-out by 2025. In 2017, the country revised its National Renewable Energy Action Plan to target 24% of its gross final energy consumption from renewable sources; this is down from 28% in a previous version. Feed-in tariffs for energy generated from small hydropower, wind, biomass/biogas and solar photovoltaics have been in effect for several years, and in 2019 feed-in premiums were extended to solar PV."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Evaluation of gas network development and expansion is underway in North Macedonia; at this time Macedonia only receives gas imports via an inlet from Bulgaria and the proposed network would connect to Greece and other neighbors. Despite network constraints, North Macedonia still has 100% access to electricity. Emphasis on expanding renewable energy is focused on increasing the amount of solar and wind energy developed and connected to the grid, as opposed to storage or other technologies. Policymakers are focusing on energy alternatives and environmental impact assessments as environmental concerns mount regarding hydropower."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The electricity market in North Macedonia was fully liberalized in 2019. Beginning in 2019, as well, all electricity consumers have the right to choose from which supplier and at what terms they obtain their power. North Macedonia has regulated and unregulated energy markets and is in the process of establishing its day-ahead market and coupling this market with neighbor Bulgaria�s. The electricity transmission authority in North Macedonia, MEPSO, is still state-owned, but generation and retail have been privatized. Renewable energy generation sources are classified as preferential producers, and the market operator is obligated to purchase all electricity from preferential producers."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"While North Macedonia has higher power prices than neighboring countries such as Serbia and Kosovo, it boasts low prices compared to EU member states. Electricity prices for fossil fuels are still subsidized, and North Macedonia has to import a substantial portion of its electricity to meet demand. Power producers are allowed to seek their own prices for electricity produced.  Due to the presence of cross-subsidies on electricity, household electricity consumers pay substantially less than the real cost, while other consumers pay more to compensate."}]}
