There are no official feed-in tariff or auction policies to support renewable power. All projects are subject to non-transparent negotiation with the government. For example, the 2020 solar tender was announced suddenly and gave foreign players little time to prepare the required documents. Many large-scale hydro projects are held back because of local NGO protests and domestic military conflicts, and this might impact future development of large scale wind projects as well. As the market is not yet liberalized, it is not clear if the state owned grid companies are willing to keep to the terms of the power purchase agreements."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Myanmar's clean energy investment has been dominated by overseas concessional finance from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. Besides, utilities from China, Europe and Southeast Asian countries are investing and developing renewable energy projects in Myanmar. Most recently Myanmar initiated a solar tender for 1.06GW of PV. The deadline was very tight, giving developers only two months to come up with bids, which has discriminated against foreign players. This means that the coming round of solar investments may see a stronger domestic showing."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Myanmar aims to generate 8% of electricity through non-hydro renewable sources by 2021, and 12% by 2025. It has a good chance to get close to its 2021 target if the 1.06GW of solar are built by next year. This is possible but could be challenging as the tender was announced in 2020 and Covid-19 could delay construction. If more solar tenders are organized by 2023-4, Myanmar could meet its 2025 target, too. All utility-scale solar is procured via tenders and there is no countrywide feed-in tariff program."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Myanmar's power demand is rising sharply, with the World bank expecting a 11% annual increase to 2030. Current capacity is insufficient to meet this demand, especially during the dry season, leading to rolling blackouts. Myanmar will need to increase its power capacity fourfold by 2030 from the 2017 level to meet its 2030 demand and the target of 100% electrification. In addition to developing utility scale gas plants and renewable power, the government has ambitious plan to build microgrid and offgrid projects across the country, with funding from multilateral development agencies."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Natural gas and large-scale hydro are two dominant sources of energy for Myanmar, accounting for over 90% of the country's installed capacity. Renewable energy is getting traction, with the country's first utility-scale solar plant of 40MW coming online in May 2019, and a tender for 1.06GW of solar finished in July 2020. Although the country's power market is still dominated by a few state owned players, it is starting to open up power generation to foreign players. Sembcorp Power, a Singaporean utility, became the first foreign independent power producer in Myanmar in 2019. Chinese players are very active in the market, and Japan's Marubeni Corporation won a $2bn tender to build a 1.25GW gas power plant in July 2020."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Power prices were low and highly subsidised before July 2019, when they were raised to fund new grid investments. Commercial and industrial prices rose by more than 60% for some commercial users. Residential rates remained the same for the smallest users (35MMK/kWh), but rose sharply for those who use more than 30kWh per month. Even the higest residential rates still remain well below those of neighboring Thailand. Similarly, residential users in neighboring India pay roughly 3x more than in Myanmar."}]}
