The country has almost completed its smart meter roll-out, with around 98% of metering points (2.9 million) now having one installed. This has led to increasingly dynamic retail tariffs at a lower price. This, together with an active consumer base, contributed to a customer switching rate of almost 21.4% in 2018 with around 60% of consumers having changed their power supplier at some point. Among those who never change their supplier, 15% have changed their tariffs or type of contract. The mixture of low electricity prices and high costs for materials and labor does represent a barrier, however, particularly within generation. A focus on hydro and wind also means that there is a constraint on the choice of generation technology."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The Norwegian clean energy sector attracted around $20 billion of investment in 2010-19, dominated by small hydro early in the period. Wind has slowly taken over, accounting for 85%% of the $3.6 billion invested in 2017-19. This is driven by the Fosen Vind complex, which comprises six onshore wind farms with a combined capacity of 1GW. It is expected that wind power will continue to dominate clean energy investments in the next few years as the country builds out its onshore wind base. This could be hampered by local opposition to wind farms, however. In addition, Equinor is likely to invest in a floating wind project or two in the coming decades."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Renewables were supported through a joint tradable green certificate scheme with Sweden, which Norway left in 2020. There is no long-term variable renewables build-up plan as the country has almost entirely decarbonized its power sector with hydroelectricity. Norway has an overall emissions reductions target of 50-55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, which will require decarbonization of other sectors. The country's vast sovereign wealth fund is a key investor and has committed to divest from all coal-related investments and instead build up its clean energy portfolio."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The business environment for renewables is positive in Norway as the country is actively pushing to increase clean generation. It is already almost entirely reliant on renewables for power generation, only using natural gas for back-up. It has therefore expanded its green focus to other sectors, such as transport, and implemented an array of tax reductions and other incentives for the purchase and ownership of electric vehicles. This helped make it the leading country for electric vehicles in Europe by absolute numbers and in the world on a per-capita basis. Power demand has been flat in recent years. As a result, there are several initiatives to attract major data centers to regions with abundant hydro resources."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Hydroelectric power is the dominant source of generation, accounting for 95% of capacity and 95% of generation in 2019. Wind and gas assets accounted for 3% and 2%, respectively. Norway, which is not a part of the European Union, has agreed to implement the EU�s third energy package and to join the bloc�s Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER). That allows the country to stay as an equal partner in the EU�s energy markets, but does take away some of its sovereignty over energy policy. The move to join ACER happened because the Norwegian wholesale power market is shared with Denmark, Sweden and Finland. Norway is not a member of the EU, and would lose equal access to the European energy market if it did not join ACER. That could put the common electricity market at risk."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Norway is split into five power price zones and has one of the lowest wholesale tariffs in Europe. In 2019, the average baseload day-ahead price was 38.95 euros per MWh. There are public concerns that power prices will increase when interconnectors to Britain and Germany are activated. The system is dominated by zero-marginal cost hydroelectric power. The tariffs are split relatively evenly between taxes, the power price and network charges"}]}
