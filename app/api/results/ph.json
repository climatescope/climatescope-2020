The project permitting process may involve dozens of agencies, causing some developers to wait over five years for approval. Utilities have limited the technologies they will contract for. Legal obstacles have made it difficult to provide renewable power for behind-the-meter projects and areas with limited power. All of this hinders setting up renewable microgrids and net metering or entering into direct power sale agreements. Limitations on foreign ownership, a lack of transmission capacity and the Philippines� archipelago geography create additional challenges to developing a project."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The Philippines has seen scattered renewables investment. Geothermal and hydro initially made up most of the build, but spiking demand caused the government to lean toward conventional power. Epira officially opened up generation to the private industry in 2001. Since then the generation sector has been dominated by thee major players. The country has had difficulty financing renewables due to challenging policy as well as infrastructure constraints. The government allows no more than 40% foreign ownership in projects. For developers, becoming a Qualified Third Party (QTP) or an Independent Power Producer (IPP) is challenging, and bottlenecks in permitting make it difficult to secure financing for projects."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Two major laws � the Electric Power Industry Reform Act (Epira) and the Renewable Energy Act � have incentivized growth of renewables in Philippines. However, the implementation of these laws has been slow, and the energy targets that were part of these laws were missed."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Over the past two decades, the Philippines went through significant energy reforms, and opened up its power industry to the private sector. However, the relationship between developers and regulators has been strained, with the former complaining about red tape and bureaucracy. While the government has created policies that allow more private participation, the failure to meet installation targets suggests a lack of follow-through. Unpermitted rooftop solar is widespread. One of the largest solar vendors widely advertises a solar-diesel-storage microgrid that is often deployed without the required permits. While policy implementation lags, both population and economic growth are expected to increase demand greatly and open up more opportunities for power development."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Historically, geothermal, oil/diesel and hydropower were the Philippines� largest sources of generation. In 2018, coal was the largest power source, at 52GWh (52%), while the share of renewables rose slightly to 23% of generation. After EPIRA liberalized the power market in 2001, Aboitiz Power, San Miguel Global Power and Trans Asia acquired the majority of assets and currently own about 62% of the total capacity. EPIRA also institutionalized the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) for the Luzon and Visayas regions, and has a target for commercial operations in Mindanao to commence in 2020. The government supports the signing of power supply agreements between large-demand consumers and developers, and has mandated utilities to facilitate customers wanting renewable power through a Green Energy Option program."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Electricity in the Philippines ranks among the most expensive in Southeast Asia. While costs are declining, it is happening at a slower rate than in neighboring countries. A lot of this is due to the country�s location. Philippines is far from the sources of its imported fuels, and power prices reflect that. Economies of scale are difficult to tap because the country is made up of more than 7,000 islands. Adding to this are ratepayer subsidies and spending on off-grid and grid-extension projects, which bump up unsubsidized rates."}]}
