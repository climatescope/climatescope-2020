The restrictions were relaxed in June 2018, but distance restrictions remain despite longer-term targets for new onshore capacity. Poland's auction program was initially beset with delays, though these seem to have been overcome. The power sector is dominated by four major utilities, all controlled by the state, which can be called on to prioritize 'national interests' even in cases where the economics may suggest another direction. Several utilities broke off long-term contracts with renewables producers when REC prices plunged, arguing they were locked into higher tariffs that did not follow the downward trajectory of certificate prices."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Poland saw just over $12 billion in new clean energy investment come in to the country from 2009-2018, an average of $1.2 billion per year. Some 20% of that total went to capex-heavy biomass investment, while 70% went to onshore wind, despite the punitive wind act introduced in 2015 that caused investment to drop. The auction program has helped investor confidence recover in wind as well as solar. The country�s largest asset finance deal since 2014 was a $182 million investment in a PV portfolio, concluded in June 2020."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Renewables projects in Poland are incentivized through auctions awarding award contracts for difference. The scheme was adopted into law in June 2018, with the first auction held in November 2018. The most recent round, in December 2019, was Europe�s largest win for onshore wind since 2017. Until July 2016 Polish clean energy projects were eligible for renewable energy credits, though prices plummeted after a regulatory change. They have since begun to recover after an increase in utilities' purchase obligations in 2018. Offshore wind has attracted investor interest, but the policy support framework has been slow to emerge. Small-scale PV has gained momentum in the last year on the back of a robust subsidy program with grants and net-metering available."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Increased power demand and higher costs for the aging coal fleet are providing opportunities for renewables. The Polish government has announced that nuclear capacity is to allow the country to move away from coal, but there is not enough time to build a nuclear power plant to cover the short-term gap left by coal retirements up to 2025. In the meantime, coal closures are accelerating due to increasingly strict emissions limits and higher operational costs. As the coal mining sector seeks restructuring, Poland may be moving toward a coal phase-out, but 90% of the country's coal-fired capacity is held by state-controlled interests."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Poland's power sector is dominated by coal, which accounted for 75% of electricity generation in 2019. The share of coal is on a steady downward trajectory, from 87% in 2012, but the country is still one of Europe's main laggards in the transition away from coal power. Its priorities remain centered on energy independence and diversification of supply. Poland introduced a capacity market to address security-of-supply concerns and provide a revenue stream for coal plant modernization. Onshore wind accounted for 10% of Poland�s total generation in 2019, and is by far the largest source of renewable power � hydro and biomass account for less than 2% each."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Wholesale power prices in Poland are relatively high and are trending upward every year as the carbon price rises, due to the country�s heavy exposure to coal. This is in contrast to the EU average which has been steadily decreasing since 2012 with the addition of zero-marginal cost renewables. Poland became a net electricity importer in 2016, as the country's aging coal fleet is inefficient and ramping it up to meet demand spikes is costly. Renewables are becoming more competitive, but their levelized cost in Poland is still the highest range in Europe among the countries tracked by BNEF. The slower uptake of competitive auctions, combined with the punitive wind act, has kept financing costs high."}]}
