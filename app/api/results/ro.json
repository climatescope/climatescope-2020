In addition, renewables developers have faced problems relating to land and planning due to a lack of transparency, uncertainty over ownership and red tape. Romania�s program for residential solar grants was officially launched in February 2019, but it took until September 2020 before a single installation had been done through the program. The administrative issues of the grant scheme has led to financial difficulties for several small-scale solar installers."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Changes to Romania�s green certificate scheme have led investment to drop substantially. Romania attracted only $120 million in clean energy investment over 2018 and 2019, the majority going to a bioethanol plant. In contrast, 2012 annual investment reached $2 billion. Romania�s renewable energy investment boom was short-lived as GC prices traded at the ceiling price (60 euros) until 2013. The government quota reductions in 2013 brought investment activity to an end, falling to just $40 million in 2015. With quotas cut and mounting GC oversupply, prices crashed to the official floor (30 euros) in 2014, where they have stayed since. Producers struggled to find offtakers for their GCs, causing distress to the point of developers disassembling operational wind farms. Clean energy investment has not recovered since. During the boom, major investors in Romania's clean energy market included BNP Paribas, UniCredit, and Citigroup in addition to the European Investment Bank and EBRD."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Romania is on course to achieve its 2020 clean energy target, despite unforeseen detours. The government established a green certificate (GC) scheme in 2008 to achieve its 2020 target of 43% renewable electricity consumption. Poor design and an unexpected drop in power demand caused the scheme to be oversubscribed. To limit upward pressure on retail electricity prices, the government imposed quota reductions. Successive reforms have failed to resolve the GC oversupply. New policies have been established to support the 2030 renewable electricity target of 49.4%. In June 2018, Romania�s parliament approved the introduction of a net-metering scheme for small-scale renewables up to 100kW, which allows individuals to deduct the power they produce from their electricity bill. Residential solar is also supported through the �Casa Verde� grant program that finally kicked off in September 2020 following administrative delays. For utility scale projects, Romania adopted regulations allowing corporate power purchase agreements for projects built after June 2020. An auction scheme starting in 2021 or 2021 is under discussion."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"In 2015, the government announced a new energy strategy for 2016-2030, calling for 1 trillion euros of investment to make Romania an eastern European energy crossroads. Energy regulator ANRE approved a 1.1-billion-euro plan to enhance the national transmission network through 2016-25. In 2020, Romania launched a post Covid-19 economic recovery plan of which approximately $14 billion will go to the energy industry, including support for Hidroelectrica�s wind projects, Complexul Energetic Oltenia�s decarbonization plan and expansion of the power grid. It also calls for two new nuclear reactors in collaboration with China, interconnectors and developing new gas finds in the Black Sea. These may leave little room for expansion of renewables in the country, though the country's aging thermal fleet will likely create a capacity gap from mid-2020s. Romania expects electricity demand to grow around 1% per year, according to estimates from the grid operator."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Half of Romania's installed generating capacity is coal, gas, and nuclear. These three technologies account for approximately two-thirds of the annual electricity generation. In renewables, hydro dominates, followed by wind, solar and biomass, which collectively generate a third of the country's electricity. Romania has gradually shifted toward a liberalized energy sector. Consumers have been eligible to switch electricity suppliers since 2007, and price liberalization was finalized for non-household consumers in 2014 and household consumers in 2018. The distribution and retail divisions have transitioned to being predominantly privately owned. Key asset owners include CEZ, Energias de Portugal (EDP) and Enel. However, CEZ has announced that it will divest all its Romania assets. Enel, which in 2015 also considered exiting the Romanian market, has since announced it will instead sell off minority stakes in its Romanian subsidiaries."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Romania's power prices were historically lower than those in neighboring Hungary and Bulgaria, but they have been steadily rising at 1-2% per year thanks to higher carbon prices and an aging coal and nuclear fleet. The expected public listing of Hidroelectrica, the state-owned hydro asset company, in September 2020, and the sale of CEZ�s assets in Romania, are meant to spur competition and could put pressure on wholesale prices. Retail power prices in Romania soared in 2019, whereas demand grew modestly. In spring 2020 prices reversed to the lowest point in five years due to the Covid-19 pandemic but have since recovered. Planned investments in new nuclear capacity would likely push up consumer bills, through a proposed subsidy scheme."}]}
