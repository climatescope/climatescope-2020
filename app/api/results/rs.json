Technology capacity caps, as part of the feed-in tariff design, are the biggest challenge facing developers. Since they can secure a preliminary approval (termed 'temporary privileged power producer' status) in the capacity budget it leaves few opportunities for new developers. The administrative procedures for permitting, construction and licensing are still quite lengthy and burdensome, despite several simplification rounds. Until the Covid-19 crisis, offtaker risk was low, yet the recent temporary PPA payment freeze may prove offputting to developers."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Serbia has secured consistent wind investments over the past three years, but other technologies have received little to no financing. Large-scale wind farms have been financed by domestic banks, foreign banks and impact funds. One of the biggest investors in Serbia's clean energy sector is MK Fintel � a joint venture between Serbia's MK Group and Italy's Fintel Energia � and it is expected to build around 60% of the country's 500MW wind-capacity target. Beyond traditional energy players, the country's wind sector has also attracted financing from Masdar, a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi's Mubadal Investment Co., where it bought a 60% stake in the recently commissioned 158MW Cibuk 1 wind farm."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Serbia is planning to achieve 27% of renewable energy in final energy consumption by 2020. Aside the steady increase of wind generation following the recent commissioning of large-scale projects, little progress has been made so far on this target. Since 2016, Serbia has offered a feed-in tariff to support wind, solar, biomass, biogas, hydro and geothermal. The feed-in tariff has been high enough to trigger capacity additions, but there are technology caps, to curb excessive build-out and ensure a manageable subsidy budget. The country is planning to replace the feed-in tariff scheme with auctions in the near future, however, their introduction has been delayed multiple times in the past. At the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, state utility EPS invoked the �force majeure� clause of its PPAs to temporarily freeze payments to privileged power producers. This freeze was only valid as long as the national state of emergency persisted and deferred, but did not annul contractual obligations."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"To meet the EU's accession requirements, specifically, adhering to the 'Large Combustion Plants Directive', at least eight coal power plants need to be shut down by 2024. The generation gap is to be replaced by two new coal power plants, a combined heat and power plant, and at least 500MW of wind capacity. Should the pressure to abandon new coal plants increase, this could offer up further potential for renewables. Since 2010, peak power demand has been more or less constant."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"In 2019, some 70% of Serbia's generation came from coal, while a quarter came from large hydro. Generation from renewable sources of powe, however, has been picking up in recent years. While in 2017, only 2% of generation came from clean energy, it was 5% two years later, in 2019. Serbia has struggled to meet the unbundling requirement under the EU's so-called third energy package. The state-owned TSO, Elektromre�a Srbija (EMS), has gained its license to operate and transmit electricity on the transmission system. To satisfy concerns over independent operation�since the government also runs the state utility, Elektroprivreda Srbije (EPS) � EPS and EMS are operated by different ministries. But generation, retail and distribution fall under the control of the state-owned utility EPS, meaning the EU Secretariat still deems Serbia non-compliant. Serbia's import and export balances are sensitive to the country's hydrology for hydro generation, the condition of its aging fossil fuel plants, and demand dynamics from its seven interconnected neighboring countries."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Commercial, retail and industrial power-price reforms were introduced in 2015. Previously, tariffs were set below the cost-recovery point for the state utility, EPS. The reforms also helped Serbia align with the EU's accession requirements. This has led to a steady increase of tariffs for end-users. At an average retail price of $97.77/MWh, tariffs are, however, still on the cheaper end."}]}
