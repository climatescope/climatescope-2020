Development, led by the government and public bodies, presents challenges in terms of timing and requires patience for investors looking to deploy capital in the country. Furthermore, the lack of transparency around the PV tenders � and the reasons for success of some bidders � is a barrier to new entrants hoping to understand the market."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The SolarNova program has been the driving force in solar PV adoption. The first four tenders under the program, awarded in 2015, 2018 and 2019, yielded 236MW of capacity. A fifth tender that is pending award will add another 60MW of capacity. While not officially disclosed, it has been reported that the winning bid for the third tender was close to zero. This underlines the confidence that developers and investors have of recovering costs through the sale of excess generation. This excess can be sold into the wholesale market or to other commercial and industrial customers. Apple�s agreement with Sunseap to power 100% of its Singapore operations with renewable-sourced electricity from the latter is an example of the direct sale model."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"The Singapore government has set goals to reduce emissions intensity, improve energy efficiency and expand solar PV installations. It is targeting up to 2GWp of installed solar capacity by 2030, of which 350MW had been installed by April 2020. Much of the development is constrained to rooftop and floating solar as the city-state�s lack of land resources (indicated by the high population density) has proved an obstacle for ground-mounted grid-scale development.20 words�"},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Singapore is a developed economy with strong legal and institutional frameworks in place to support business transactions and financing arrangements. The country has world-class infrastructure and office space, and a highly educated English speaking workforce. The government is also keen to attract foreign investment and developers into the market and is likely to attract more foreign players for subsequent tender rounds for SolarNova and floating PV projects."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Tuas Power Generation, Senoko Energy, YTLPowerSeraya, Keppel Merlimau Cogen, Sembcorp Cogen, PacificLight and Tuaspring account for more than 90% of the generation capacity in Singapore. Half-hourly price-quantity bid offers are submitted to the wholesale market operated by the Energy Market Company � a subsidiary of Singapore Exchange. Prior to the inception of the OEM, only consumers whose monthly consumption exceeded 2MWh (�contestable� consumers) were allowed to purchase electricity from licensed private retailers. Those who did not meet this consumption threshold (�non-contestable� consumers) had to purchase electricity at the regulated tariff from state-owned utility SP Group. Under the OEM regime, which rolled-out island wide in May 2019, all consumers, regardless of their monthly consumption, are allowed to purchase electricity from a licensed retailer. The retail market is highly competitive, with 29 licensed firms, out of which 12 are competing in the residential segment."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Singapore�s power prices are linked to the price of oil; the city-state is 95% dependent on imported natural gas for generation, most of which is purchased at oil-linked prices. The average wholesale electricity price (Uniform Singapore Electricity Price or USEP) for 2018 was S$110/MWh � a slight increase after years of price-depression caused by a large system reserve margin. The reserve margin stood at 80% in 2018 but is expected to fall to 58% in 2019, and go further down to 40% by 2022 following the retirement of 2,600MW of generation capacity. The liberalization of electricity retail in Singapore under the Open Electricity Market (OEM) regime in 2019 may mitigate somewhat the upward pressure on electricity bills from potentially higher wholesale prices emanating from declining reserve margins."}]}
