In 2009, investors were unable to obtain permission for projects above 10kW from the grid operator (SEPS) which considers wind unstable and prone to price fluctuations. Meanwhile, smaller turbines are hindered by regulation and legislation, including those for protected bird sites covering 23% of the country. As for PV, the government only offers the household subsidy for projects up to 10kW."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Investment in Slovakia's clean energy sector has been limited by administrative barriers, policy uncertainty, and the focus on nuclear expansion. Solar saw a modest boom in 2010-11, attracting $2.5 billion in total. But this trend stagnated after the government made legislative amendments in 2011, removing renewables support for newly permitted PV plants over 100kW. PV investment has since shown signs of recovery with a total of 56% growth rate over 2017-2018 thanks to a small-scale solar subisdy. Plans for a 560MW hydro power plant, financed and constructed by Chinese companies, were unveiled in April 2015. More recently, a solar investment deal worth $63 million was signed on January 2019 and could further boost the share of renewables in Slovakia's power generation."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Slovakia aims 27.3% renewables in the electricity sector and will reach the goal given the current policies and activities. Slovakia has launched the country�s first technology-neutral, large scale renewable energy auction Feb 2020. However, the first RES auction round was cancelled on April 1 due to Covid-19. The feed-in tariff remains in place for existing installations, with rates that are administratively adjusted every year. This had created uncertainty for renewable developers and investors, particularly as the premium fell roughly 30% across technologies between 2016 and 2017. The new scheme aims to address this volatility. Slovakia also provides a bonus payment for the generation of the first 5MW (15MW for wind) of capacity, which supports mainly small-scale installations. Renewable electricity consumption is exempt from the excise duty of 1.32 euros/MWh, and such projects benefit from priority dispatch to the grid."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The most controversial topic around Slovakia�s power sector has been the ongoing dispute over Enel�s intended sale of its 66% stake in the national utility Slovenske Elektrarne. The government was determined to force Enel to complete the two new reactors at Mochovce. In July 2016, Enel sold half of its stake to privately held Czech-Slovak energy investment group EPH for 375 million euros. The sale of Enel's remaining 33% stake for the same amount will happen once it completes its Mochove nuclear plant, and is still planned for 2020 or 2021."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Generating capacity fairly evenly distributed among nuclear, coal- and gas-fired generation, and renewables (80% of which is hydro). The largest producer is Slovenske Elektrarne (Enel), which delivers over two-thirds of the country's power generation. In 2017, retirement of 1.61GW of large hydro and oil capacity caused a drop in generating capacity by 18% which increases Slovakia's dependancy on import. The government aims to reduce import dependence. However, its main tool to achieve that is through an 880MW extension of the Mochovce nuclear power plant � an extension that started construction in 1985 but has been subject to delays. The government has also sought to improve power market integration, with short-term trading with the Czech Republic and Hungary starting in 2012, and the day-ahead market coupled with the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania opening in late 2014."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Slovakia's power prices are slightly lower than the European average, and broadly align with neighboring Austria and the Czech Republic. The country is part of the 'Central' area, which includes Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic. Wholesale and industrial electricity prices in Slovakia rose in 2016 for the first time since 2011, along with the EU average. The driver was upward pressure from gas prices, which increased as a result of rising demand from cold weather and reduced nuclear capacity in the region. Commercial and residential tariffs in Slovakia continued to rise in 2019, increasing the incentive to install small-scale PV systems."}]}
